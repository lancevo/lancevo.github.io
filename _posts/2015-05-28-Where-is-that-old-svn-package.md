Because the project was checked in SVN repos with a newer version 1.8.10 
and SVN came with WebStorm on Mac OS X is a lot older than that version, so I can't checkout the project in WebStorm. 
I ran into this several times while helping other developer to setup their dev environment. 
So this post should saves me time in the future :)  

1. Go to [Wandisco](https://www.wandisco.com/subversion/os/downloads), download the binary package for right SVN version
2. Install it
3. Change SVN path in Webstorm to the newly installed SVN

#Back Button Focus

Settings (Gear Icon - 2nd Menu) -> 3:  Pre-AF:Off, AF w/ shutter: Off  
Settings (Gear Icon - 2nd Menu) -> 6 -> Custom Key Settings -> 1 :  AEL Button = AF On  

So now back button focus is the AEL button.


#Eye AF

You must have the camera set to `Wide Focus Area` and the focus mode must be in `AF-A` for (auto), 
otherwise the eye focus won't work. (that is very confusing of Sony). 
Also, the AE Track Duration should be set to "Normal". 
If you didn't know any better, you would probably chose "High", 
but then the face/eye tracking jumps around and off your target person very easily. 
"Normal" means it will Hold-On to your target as them move around. This is also deceiving. 
I am not sure about holding down the button, though. 
In his video, it shows a face detection box around the persons face 
until right when the shutter releases, then the box gets very small and goes right to the eye. 
Then you will know that it actually focused on the eye. (You also have to have face detection on as well).
